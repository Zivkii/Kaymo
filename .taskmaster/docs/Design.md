# PRD: UX/UI Design for Somalia Deforestation Interactive Landing Page  
*Stripe.com-inspired, Single-Page Experience*

---

## 1. Overview

This PRD defines the UX/UI requirements for an interactive, scroll-based landing page that educates users about Somalia’s deforestation crisis. The page will deliver all core information and data through a seamless, Stripe.com-inspired design, using interactive visualizations and elegant source attribution—no subpages, just a rich, engaging scroll experience.

---

## 2. Design Principles

- **Single-Page, Scroll-First:** All content and interactions are contained within a single, vertically scrolling landing page.
- **Stripe-Inspired Aesthetics:** Clean, modern, and minimal design with generous whitespace, bold typography, and smooth micro-interactions[1][4][6][7][9].
- **Instant Comprehension:** Visual hierarchy and progressive disclosure guide users from headline stats to deeper insights.
- **Interactivity:** Dynamic, animated elements respond to scroll, hover, and tap.
- **Elegance & Trust:** Subtle, integrated source attribution throughout.

## 3. Core UX/UI Features

### 3.1 Layout & Structure

- **Hero Section:**  
  - Animated headline metric (e.g., “1.03% annual deforestation”) and interactive map background.
  - CTA button (e.g., “Learn More” scrolls to next section).

- **Scroll Narrative:**  
  - Sectioned content:  
    1. **Key Metrics** (animated counters, e.g., hectares lost, species threatened)
    2. **Causes** (infographic with icons and short text)
    3. **Trends & Timelines** (scroll-triggered charts, e.g., forest cover loss over time)
    4. **Impacts** (side-by-side visuals: biodiversity, soil, water, climate)
    5. **Socioeconomic Effects** (story cards with illustrations)
    6. **Solutions & Initiatives** (progress bars, icons, and mini-case studies)
    7. **Call to Action** (advocacy, donation, or share)

- **Sticky Navigation Bar:**  
  - Minimal, fades in/out as user scrolls, with section jump links.

### 3.2 Interactive Visualizations

- **Charts & Graphs:**  
  - D3.js/Chart.js-powered, animate on scroll into view.
  - Hover/click reveals tooltips with data and source badges.

- **Interactive Map:**  
  - Mapbox integration, highlights regions as user scrolls to related content.
  - Clickable markers for major deforestation hotspots.

- **Infographics:**  
  - Custom SVGs, animated as user scrolls.

### 3.3 Micro-Interactions & Feedback

- **Scroll Animations:**  
  - Section transitions, fade-ins, and parallax effects.
- **Hover Effects:**  
  - Cards and data points subtly lift or highlight.
- **Loading States:**  
  - Stripe-style skeleton loaders for visuals.

### 3.4 Source Attribution

- **Inline Source Badges:**  
  - Small, color-coded icons next to data points (e.g., UN, FAO).
- **Popover on Hover/Click:**  
  - Shows full citation, credibility indicator, and last verified date.
- **Footer Bibliography:**  
  - Collapsible, filterable source list with direct links.

## 4. Visual Style Guide

- **Typography:**  
  - Sans-serif (e.g., Inter or Stripe’s Ideal Sans), bold headlines, clear body text.
- **Color Palette:**  
  - Deep blue (#0A2540), accent blue (#0570DE), soft grays, white backgrounds.
  - Data visualizations use a colorblind-friendly palette.
- **Spacing:**  
  - 8px grid, ample padding/margins.
- **Buttons:**  
  - Rounded, bold, with subtle transitions.

---

## 5. Accessibility & Responsiveness

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:**  
  - Contrast, keyboard navigation, alt text, ARIA labels.
- **Responsive Design:**  
  - All elements adapt smoothly to mobile, tablet, and desktop.
  - Touch-friendly controls and swipeable charts on mobile.

---

## 6. User Flow

1. **Landing:**  
   - See animated stat and map.
2. **Scroll Down:**  
   - Progressively discover causes, trends, impacts, and solutions.
3. **Interact:**  
   - Hover/click for deeper data and source info.
4. **Act:**  
   - Reach CTA section (advocacy, donation, or share).

## 7. Strategic Implementation Recommendations

### 7.1 Content Prioritization Strategy
- **Emotional Impact First:** Lead with animated deforestation statistics and before/after imagery to create immediate connection
- **Progressive Data Complexity:** Start with accessible visualizations, then provide deeper analytical tools for research users
- **Actionable Outcomes:** End each section with clear next steps (policy recommendations, donation paths, advocacy actions)

### 7.2 Data Visualization Priorities
**Phase 1 Core Visualizations (MVP):**
- Hero animated deforestation rate counter (1.03% annual rate)
- Interactive timeline slider showing forest cover decline
- Regional comparison chart (Somalia vs. neighboring countries)
- Impact correlation engine linking charcoal exports to forest loss

**Phase 2 Enhanced Features:**
- Advanced infographic generator for custom data views
- Machine learning forecast visualizations
- Real-time policy intervention impact modeling

### 7.3 Cross-PRD Integration Points
- **Data Source Alignment:** Ensure D3.js charts directly interface with the credibility system from Kaymo.md
- **User Journey Mapping:** Connect scroll narrative structure with the three-tier user personas (policy makers, researchers, public)
- **Source Attribution UX:** Integrate bibliography portal design with inline badge hover interactions

### 7.4 Technical Architecture Refinements
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 with App Router for optimal performance and SEO
- **Animation Library:** Framer Motion for scroll animations (more maintainable than custom solutions)
- **Analytics Integration:** Vercel Analytics to track user engagement with different data sections
- **Visualization Stack:** 
  - D3.js for custom interactive charts
  - Chart.js for lightweight standard graphs
  - Mapbox GL JS for spatial deforestation data
- **Source Management:**  
  - JSON/YAML citation store with automated link verification
  - Wayback Machine integration for linkrot prevention
- **Performance Optimization:**  
  - Lazy-load heavy assets with intersection observer
  - Code splitting by data visualization modules
  - Optimized SVGs and WebP image formats
- **SEO & Discoverability:**  
  - Schema.org structured data (Dataset, Map, Article)
  - Targeted keyword optimization: "Somalia deforestation," "charcoal impact"
  - Pre-rendering for social media sharing

### 7.5 Mobile-First Considerations
- **Touch Interactions:** Swipeable charts and pinch-to-zoom maps
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Core data accessible without JavaScript
- **Offline Capability:** Service worker for cached essential data
